# MERN-based Instagram full-stack clone 

This is my single-handedly created full-stack clone which I tried to develop nearly a production level project.
I implemented all possible optimization practices, responsiveness, and near-to-production-ready coding methodology.

- I have targeted the following features to implement and learn-
  - Infinite scrolling of feeds.
  - CRUD- operation for like/comment/save posts.
  - Multi-user accessibility of application.
  - Oauth implementation for authentication.
  - Following and follower feature.
  - Open and private account features.
  - Multi-story upload feature and seen by followers only if private account.
  - Notification of like/comments/tags/messages.
  - Chat with followers.
  - Show feed skeleton while loading like the actual application.

- For this Insta clone I have used the following main tech stack-
  - Reactjs
  - Tailwindcss
  - Nodejs
  - Express
  - MongoDB
 
- I have used the following dependent libraries-
  - Redux-toolkit
  - React-loading-library
  - React-query
  - React-router-dom
  - Facebook OAuth
  - Google Oauth
  - Jwt
  - Winston
 
- I have used the following for optimization-
  - Cloudflare CDN for static files.
  - Use of react.memo
  - Use of useCallback
  - Use of useMemo(as per requirement)
  - Image webP formatting before storing.
  - Use of state management library like redux-toolkit and inbuilt contextApi.
  - Use of higher-order components where ever necessary.

- I have used the following technique to make it a production-ready application-
  - Used logger library to log request like Winston.
  - Created global error handling for both frontend and backend.
  - Used MVC structure to create a clean backend.

- I have used the following tech to implement chat features nearly like Instagram.
   - {# Pending part will implement later}
